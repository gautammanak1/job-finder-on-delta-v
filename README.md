- RapidAPI account and subscription to the Indeed API
- Installed Python packages: `requests`, `uagents`

## Installation

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gautammanak1/job-finder-on-delta-v.git
   cd job-finder-on-delta-v


## Install the required Python packages

```sh
pip install uagents

```
## Setup
1. **Subscribe to the Indeed API on RapidAPI:**

- Go to RapidAPI.
- Search for the Indeed API.
- Subscribe to the API and get your API key.
  
2.**Update the Script with Your API Key 🔑 :**

- Find the line where rapidapi_key is defined and add your RapidAPI key

```sh
rapidapi_key = "your_rapidapi_key_here"  # Add your RapidAPI key here

```

## Usage
